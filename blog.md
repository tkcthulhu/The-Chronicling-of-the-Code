**First week on the Red Pills :pill:**

***Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?***

> So, my first week at Awesome Inc., to be honest I had no idea what to expect here but have been pleasantly surprised all the same. I'm 
getting to know my computer much more than I ever have, and getting familiar with so many different tools is a bit daunting, but I'm excited
to keep pushing forward and see what I can accomplish! My time managment wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be this week and I wish I had been able to put more time into the first iteration of this blog, but 20/20 hindsight right? I do suppose I have 15 more weeks to work on it.

***What are you excited or eager to learn more about?***

> Something I can't wait to learn more about is programming problem solving engines and what all goes into AI. A future challenge I'd like 
to accomplish is to build a chess engine from scratch!

***What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?***

> That I think Tim Henson is the most technically proficient guitarist to ever live.
