**First week on the red pills**

**08/25/2022**

***Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?***

> So, my first week at Awesome Inc., to be honest I had no idea what to expect here but have been pleasantly surprised all the same. I'm 
getting to know my computer much more than I ever have, and getting familiar with so many different things is a bit daunting, but I can't
wait to keep pushing forward and see where I am in 16 weeks!

***Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?***

> Something I can't wait to learn more about is programming problem solving engines and what all goes into AI. A future challenge I'd like 
to accomplish is to build a chess engine from scratch!

***What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?***

> Something you will only learn about me on this blog is that I think Tim Henson is the most technically proficient guitarist to ever live.
