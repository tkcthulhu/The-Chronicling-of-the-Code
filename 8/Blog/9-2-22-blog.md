**Failing Forward**

***What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?***

> Something I'd be really interested to get better at is fleshed out NAV menus with drop down menus and everything, like with a full animation.

***What are you struggling with?***

> Apparently reading a project description thoroughly.

***How do you solve a problem?***

> Generally I like to envision my end product, then I take account of all the tools I have availible, then think about how I can implement each tool efficently.

***What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?***

>Smacking my head againt it for a while generally works pretty well, but honestly, I'll pick an approach and stick with that for a while with various modifiecations, if that doesn't end up working I will take a step back and try to reasses my approach and make changes if I need to, research the issue, and come back with new tools.
