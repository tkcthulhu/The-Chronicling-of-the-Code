***What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?***

>Personally, I think it's definitley important to keep everything somewhat seperate. I like the idea of how each one builds on the functionality of another one. HTML and CSS are absolutely the most "user friendly" and closest to plain english, like "hmmmm what could ```backgroound-color {red}``` possibly mean? Javascript is much more challenging but still as I'm learning, it continues to make sense once you get past reading the syntx.

***What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?***

>Love it, for someone who has very little experience with any sort of actual coding but has done many projects of other sorts its incredibly helpful. I find that no matter what project I'm working on that it is only as good as how well I've planned it. This is a great way for me to break things down into steps that I can then look up and get the actual syntax for what I'm trying to achieve and learn.
