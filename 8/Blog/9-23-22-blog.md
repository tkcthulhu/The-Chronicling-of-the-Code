***What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?***
>Honestly the main thing that holds me back is getting zeroed in on some small detail of a project or something to the point that I stop paying attention to the scope of the rest of the project. It is something that I will continue to work on and try to get better about.
>
***What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?***
>For bootstrap I'd really just love to be able to use it closer to it's full potential instead of just always using CSS overrides for everything.
>
***How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?***
>So much better, I feel far more connected with fellow students and my instructors as well. I don't think that anyones personality really comes off well on zoom, including my own, and that having the opportunity to have small comradery building moments with people is something you'll never get in a completely remote setting.
>
***What is your “Why”?***
>I was tired of working jobs where I was constantly having to put family time and personal life second, where I was never able to apply myself to my full potential. This seemed like something that I was really going to enjoy, something that would constantly challenge me, and something that would be rewarding for a very long time.
