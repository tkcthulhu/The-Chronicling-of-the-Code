When the opportunity for getting a start in this field via the Awesome Inc. Web Developer bootcamp was offered to me I knew that I had to take it, there my love for logic problems and puzzles finally met its match in the world of programming. We were challenged every week with a task that was just barely out of our reach, from Tic-Tac-Toe to To-Do Lists, from Weather Apps to D&D, and every week the amount that I learned was multiplied exponentially and my understanding of the craft grew fast and faster. After 16 weeks in this program I can confidently say that my name is Tyler Consalvi, and I am a Full Stack Developer.</p>
