                    So, my first week at Awesome Inc., to be honest I had no idea what to expect here but have been pleasantly surprised all the same. I'm 
                    getting to know my computer much more than I ever have, and getting familiar with so many different tools is a bit daunting, but I'm excited
                    to keep pushing forward and see what I can accomplish! My time managment wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be this week and I wish I had been 
                    able to put more time into the first iteration of this blog, but 20/20 hindsight right? I do suppose I have 15 more weeks to work on it.

                    <br/>
                    Something I can't wait to learn more about is programming problem solving engines and what all goes into AI. A future challenge I'd like 
                    to accomplish is to build a chess engine from scratch!

                    Generally I like to envision my end product, then I take account of all the tools I have availible, then think about how I can implement each tool efficently.

                    Smacking my head againt it for a while generally works pretty well, but honestly, I'll pick an approach and stick with that for a while with various modifiecations, 
                    if that doesn't end up working I will take a step back and try to reasses my approach and make changes if I need to, research the issue, and come back with new tools.

                    <br/>
                    Personally, I think it's definitley important to keep everything somewhat seperate. I like the idea of how each one builds on the functionality of another one. 
                    HTML and CSS are absolutely the most "user friendly" and closest to plain english, like "hmmmm what could backgroound-color: red possibly mean? Javascript is much 
                    more challenging but still as I'm learning, it continues to make sense once you get past reading the syntax.

                    <br/>
                    Love it, for someone who has very little experience with any sort of actual coding but has done many projects of other sorts its incredibly helpful. I find that no 
                    matter what project I'm working on that it is only as good as how well I've planned it. This is a great way for me to break things down into steps that I can then look 
                    up and get the actual syntax for what I'm trying to achieve and learn.
