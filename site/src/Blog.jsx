                    So, my first week at Awesome Inc., to be honest I had no idea what to expect here but have been pleasantly surprised all the same. I'm 
                    getting to know my computer much more than I ever have, and getting familiar with so many different tools is a bit daunting, but I'm excited
                    to keep pushing forward and see what I can accomplish! My time managment wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be this week and I wish I had been 
                    able to put more time into the first iteration of this blog, but 20/20 hindsight right? I do suppose I have 15 more weeks to work on it.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Something I can't wait to learn more about is programming problem solving engines and what all goes into AI. A future challenge I'd like 
                    to accomplish is to build a chess engine from scratch!

                    Something I'd be really interested to get better at is fleshed out NAV menus with drop down menus and everything, like with a full animation.

                    Generally I like to envision my end product, then I take account of all the tools I have availible, then think about how I can implement each tool efficently.

                    Smacking my head againt it for a while generally works pretty well, but honestly, I'll pick an approach and stick with that for a while with various modifiecations, 
                    if that doesn't end up working I will take a step back and try to reasses my approach and make changes if I need to, research the issue, and come back with new tools.
