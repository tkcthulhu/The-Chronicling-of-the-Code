                    <br/>
                    These past few weeks have been all about learning C#, so far I've built close to 10 projects in the language and have been working on a new iteration of the 
                    EverCraft Kata (https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata) which is a challenge to build a character creation module using Object Oriented Programming
                    and test driven development. Getting comfortable in Visual Studio has taken some time and Microsoft... come one, just give me the keyboard shortcuts from 
                    Visual Studio Code! I miss my multicursors!! Other than that though, the IDE makes it incredibly simple to set up and network projects in a .NET Core 
                    environment and the built in testing suite is excellent, networking it with the GitHub Desktop Client was surprisingly simple. 

                    The job hunt goes on, but I still feel confident that I will get the job I'm meant to have here. To be perfectly honest, last week was rough, we talk about "The Desert of Despair" alot in bootcamp, and man I was in it. I hit about 50
                    apps put out into the wild and so far have only heard back on one (recruiters, please just let me know one way or another) and I was feeling pretty down on the 
                    whole process. I met up with one of my friends that went through the same bootcamp that I did though, and we had an excellent discussion, he was in the job market for
                    nearly 4 months, and put out nearly 200 applications before he got into the role he is in now. The takeaway from that for me though was that he is happier
                    in his work than he has ever been in his life, and there's a reason he recommended this to me. 

                    I also came across a notecard in my backpack from bootcamp that I wrote to myself so many weeks ago, we called it the "why" statement, why am I doing this? 
                    Why did I choose this path? Now as it was back then, my reason is my family, I want a career where I'm not spending every waking second running around trying
                    to make ends meet, where I have time with my family, where I'm not so dog tired at the end of a shift that I jsut pass out on the couch after being home for 5
                    minutes. My family deserves better than that, and so do I. So I'm hitting the ground next week running, with renewed moral, becasue I remember why I'm on this 
                    path.

                    Well, so far the life afer bootcamp has been.. weird. going from diving in day in and day out to projects, seeing friends and having defined ciriculum to work with to being the master of my own schooling, managing meetings with connections made, 
                    sending out applications every day. It has been a huge change, but I know this will work out. I put too much blood, sweat, and tears into this to give up on it. Rejection hurts, but knowing that you gave up hurts worse, I know that there is someone 
                    out there thats going to finally take a chance on me, and I honestly believe they will be happy they did when they see what I am capable of. This is worth it, I know it, I just have to keep pushing.

                    <br/>
                    Well, this has been the year of the journey for me, I left my previous profession of almost 10 years to pursue something more fufilling. 
                    I tried a few different avenues and couldn't really seem to find something I liked, I have struggled a lot this year until I finally landed at the bootcamp.
                    my family has been through a lot over that time, my wife and I have worked day and night to keep our house running and keep the lights on, but it has been worth
                    it. After taking these last few weeks to have some rest and take a step back from the computer and ground myself, I'm reminded again of my 'why' that I 
                    wrote on that note card so many weeks ago. I have spent more time with my family in the last 2 weeks than I have all year and I couldn't be more more grateful
                    for all the wonderful things in my life. The future, while still daunting, is looking brighter and brighter, always forward, never back.

                    <br/>
                    In Agile Development the thing that I have found to be most helpful to me is breaking up huge projects that seem almost impossible at first and breaking them up 
                    into easy to manage, bite sized chunks called tickets. This way you have a clear and definite goal for each piece of the puzzle and can make measurable progress. 
                    You also get that sweet seratonin hit of adding tickets to the done pile and watching the stack grow. I'm also a huge fan of the way that most agile companies are 
                    fairly lax on the work day timing, as long as your work is completed to satisfaction by deadline, you are in good standing.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    So let's go with DRF or Django REST Framework, the benefits here are that you can create incredibly complex databases and send information back and forth from 
                    frontend to backend while only having to focus on the problem at hand. I never have to stop and completely build a feature from scratch or spend hours trying to 
                    figure out the networking, someone much smarter than me has already done that. All I have to focus on is adapting documentation and examples to the current 
                    problem I am facing.

                    <br/>
                    Mainly the networking of databases and how the different tables connect to each other, especially in a more complex app, putting these all together and
                    networking the proper tables to the proper portions of the apps are definetly going to require more planning than some other aspects of the programming 
                    process. It's also the newest part of the stack for me to once I've really had some time to wrap my head around these things it'll be easier.

                    I would really like to hear from LightWell, and maybe some mobile app development or game development companies, or even cyber security I know that 
                    obviously focus of our bootcamp is web development, but seeing more variety of what we can work on with these new skills long term would be awesome.

                    I guess the hardest hurdle this week has more or less been the realization of where we are in the process, like, we are almost out of this bootcap and on
                    to the real world again, it's terrifying and exciting at the same time. I didn't really have a whole lot of huge problems with the connection other than 
                    just getting the CORS stuff ironed out and learning what I need to do there. It does make me a little nervous for building something with user authentication
                    and more advanced security but hey... I'll have to build it eventually right?

                    <em>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?</em>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In my opinion they are fairly similar in logic, Python has a lot more straight forward syntax and easier implementation of some functionalities like
                    the sum of an array, but then if we try to do a loop, suddenly I have to manually create and increment an iterable if I want to use one, and there are 
                    little back and forths like that throughout both of them, in retrospect I am much happier that we learned JavaScript first because with the amount of 
                    syntax required for a JS or JSX document, learning the quirks of python was a piece of cake (Except for sibling file imports, don't got there, that 
                    place is evil.)
                    <br/>

                    <em>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?</em>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I kind of covered this in my last answer but I do feel like Python to JS would have been a much heavier lift than JS to Python was, with the easy to
                    read syntax and plain english quality I think I might have had a harder time understanding what was going on in JS coming from Python whereas going JS 
                    into Python I could understand what was happening off the bat and picking up the syntax wasn't difficult.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <em>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a 
                    better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?</em>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Working with the databases this week has definetly started to give me an idea of what constructing the full back end of an application can take and I 
                    have a huge appreciation for it. I have started turning some gears as far as figuring out how I'm going to need to structure the backend of my final 
                    project and I plan on in the coming weeks trying to map out that database with a flow chart. I wish I hadn't gotten sick this week because I feel like 
                    I have a decent gap to make up for Thursdays build time because thats usually the day I really hit that full grasp of the concepts and have everything 
                    click, hopefully I'll have some time this weekend to dig a little farther into join and inserts and some other SQL fucntionalities. I really want to be 
                    able to monetize my final project long term and a solid database is going to be a huge part of making a clean and well fucntioning application.

                    <br/>
                    For me it was the initial learning curve of how programming works and the convenetions and tools available to me, the fact that you can create literally 
                    whatever you want was both exciting and very daunting. However, once I managed to wrap my head around the possibilities of programming everything started 
                    to fall into place and I was able to really dive into it. The next thing to wrap my head around is definetly this accessing the database and manipulating 
                    data, keeping track of everything in the esther will definetly be a hurdle but I'm confident I'll be able to overcome it.

                    <br/>
                    If anything I've become more solidified on my selection of project, my coach I work with for my training has offered to do some user testing and give me

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Honestly, the biggest surprise was the similarity in both functionality and syntax, Python very much strikes me as it was written by someone that had 
                    spent quite a bit of time working in something like JavaScript and thought "Why do I have to use &&? Why can't I just say 'and'? This is stupid I'm 
                    writing my own language", and the rest of the language very much follows that same methodology. I was suprised at how easy it was to pick up after the 
                    initial pain of learing JS, but this time I didn't have to learn how programming worked, just some new syntax and quirks. I'd very much liken picking up 
                    Python to learning a dialect of a language, all the basic thing are still the same and they are structured very similarly, but there are some subtle 
                    differences and some overt ones too, but once you get past those and get them down it's almost the same thing.

                    Pseudocode is a form of planning that programmers use to layout something that they are going to build, similar to a blueprint for the construction of a building. 
                    The programmer can lay their instructions out in plain English and work through the logic of the build without having to deal with limitations or caveats of syntax. 
                    It allows a free flow string of thought to be put down and then edited and built out into a full map of how to build and structure your program or feature, it can include 
                    variables, functions, loops, and logic flow and can also continually be reworked to fit the program as it grows and changes throughout the development process. 
                    Writing your pseudocode well can mean the difference between spending hours trying to work out a functions syntax because you don’t know exactly what you need to 
                    accomplish and turning that into a quick series of google searches to find the right tool for the job, and it can mean the difference between a neat and concise program 
                    and a program that has things out of order and riddled with scoping issues. Pseudocode is here to make your process easier in the long run, and to help you voice what you 
                    need to accomplish to locate gaps in knowledge to fill and potential shortcomings in your process. Write it and write it well, you’ll be happy you did.

                    <br/>
                    The manner of thinking is probably what the biggest changes for me have been made in, it's all about tools and how you use them and manipulate them, even creating 
                    your own to make your own work easier.

                    Be humble, there is always more to learn, there is always a better solution, there is always someone better than you, but how you take these things will make more 
                    difference than any amount of knowledge you could possibly aquire. Always take the opportunity to learn and better yourself and come back a stronger developer and a

                    <br/>
                    Honestly the main thing that holds me back is getting zeroed in on some small detail of a project or something to the point that I stop paying attention to the scope 
                    of the rest of the project. It is something that I will continue to work on and try to get better about.

                    <br/>
                    For bootstrap I'd really just love to be able to use it closer to it's full potential instead of just always using CSS overrides for everything.

                    So much better, I feel far more connected with fellow students and my instructors as well. I don't think that anyones personality really comes off well on zoom, 
                    including my own, and that having the opportunity to have small comradery building moments with people is something you'll never get in a completely remote setting.

                    <br/>
                    I was tired of working jobs where I was constantly having to put family time and personal life second, where I was never able to apply myself to my full potential. 
                    This seemed like something that I was really going to enjoy, something that would constantly challenge me, and something that would be rewarding for a very long time.

                    <br/>
                    Having the freedom to move around with personal life vs. school tasks as needed (i.e. picking up the kid from school, working on my own schedule, doing chores and such). 
                    Also even though we weren't in person, Josh and Jonathan were both super accommodating with questions and helping us out when we needed it which I wasn't sure how that was 
                    going to go when I heard that we would be remote for the first 4 weeks.

                    <br/>
                    Honestly the main thing that hindered progress was my own dersire to figure out things on my own without help, though that practice was quicky brought to end. The material 
                    is difficult and learning and asking questions is why I'm here in the first place.

                    Sometimes, you just have to sit down and tell yourself "I am not moving until I make some damn progress", it'll be gritty and frustrating, and you'll have to eat some pride, 
                    once again, it's why I'm here.

                    <br/>
                    Personally, I think it's definitley important to keep everything somewhat seperate. I like the idea of how each one builds on the functionality of another one. 
                    HTML and CSS are absolutely the most "user friendly" and closest to plain english, like "hmmmm what could <code>backgroound-color : red;</code> possibly mean? Javascript 
                    is much more challenging but still as I'm learning, it continues to make sense once you get past reading the syntx.

                    <br/>
                    Love it, for someone who has very little experience with any sort of actual coding but has done many projects of other sorts its incredibly helpful. I find that no matter what project I'm working on that it is only as good as how well I've planned it. This is a great way for me to break things down into steps that I can then look up and get the actual syntax for what I'm trying to achieve and learn.
