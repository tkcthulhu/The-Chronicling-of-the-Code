                    <strong>08/25/2022</strong>

                    <strong>First week on the Red Pills :pill:</strong>

                    <strong>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</strong>

                    So, my first week at Awesome Inc., to be honest I had no idea what to expect here but have been pleasantly surprised all the same. I'm 
                    getting to know my computer much more than I ever have, and getting familiar with so many different tools is a bit daunting, but I'm excited
                    to keep pushing forward and see what I can accomplish! My time managment wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be this week and I wish I had been able to put more time into the first iteration of this blog, but 20/20 hindsight right? I do suppose I have 15 more weeks to work on it.

                    <strong>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</strong>

                    Something I can't wait to learn more about is programming problem solving engines and what all goes into AI. A future challenge I'd like 
                    to accomplish is to build a chess engine from scratch!

                    <strong>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</strong>

                    That I think Tim Henson is the most technically proficient guitarist to ever live.
