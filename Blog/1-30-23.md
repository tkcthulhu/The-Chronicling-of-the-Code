Well, so far the life afer bootcamp has been.. weird. going from diving in day in and day out to projects, seeing friends and having defined ciriculum to work with
to being the master of my own schooling, managing meetings with connections made, sending out applications every day. It has been a huge change, but I know this
will work out. I put too much blood, sweat, and tears into this to give up on it. Rejection hurts, but knowing that you gave up hurts worse, I know that
there is someone out there thats going to finally take a chance on me, and I honestly believe they will be happy they did when they see what I am capable of.
This is worth it, I know it, I just have to keep pushing.
