Describe Agile Development or a specific ceremony (stand up, retro, sprints, etc.)

  In Agile Development the thing that I have found to be most helpful to me is breaking up huge projects that seem almost impossible at first and breaking them up into easy to manage, bite sized chunks called tickets. This way you have a clear and definite goal for each piece of the puzzle and can make measurable progress. You also get that sweet seratonin hit of adding tickets to the done pile and watching the stack grow. I'm also a huge fan of the way that most agile companies are fairly lax on the work day timing, as long as your work is completed to satisfaction by deadline, you are in good standing.

Convince someone who does not use frameworks why using a framework is beneficial. (Bootstrap, React, Django, or DRF)

  So let's go with DRF or Django REST Framework, the benefits here are that you can create incredibly complex databases and send information back and forth from frontend to backend while only having to focus on the problem at hand. I never have to stop and completely build a feature from scratch or spend hours trying to figure out the networking, someone much smarter than me has already done that. All I have to focus on is adapting documentation and examples to the current problem I am facing.
