What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?

  Mainly the networking of databases and how the different tables connect to each other, especially in a more complex app, putting these all together and
  networking the proper tables to the proper portions of the apps are definetly going to require more planning than some other aspects of the programming 
  process. It's also the newest part of the stack for me to once I've really had some time to wrap my head around these things it'll be easier.

What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and learn?

  I would really like to hear from LightWell, and maybe some mobile app development or game development companies, or even cyber security I know that 
  obviously focus of our bootcamp is web development, but seeing more variety of what we can work on with these new skills long term would be awesome.

After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point for you? Were you able to reconnect your React 
Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so, what was that like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump? 

  I guess the hardest hurdle this week has more or less been the realization of where we are in the process, like, we are almost out of this bootcap and on
  to the real world again, it's terrifying and exciting at the same time. I didn't really have a whole lot of huge problems with the connection other than 
  just getting the CORS stuff ironed out and learning what I need to do there. It does make me a little nervous for building something with user authentication
  and more advanced security but hey... I'll have to build it eventually right?
