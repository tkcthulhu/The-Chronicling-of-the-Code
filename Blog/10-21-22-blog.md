What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
  I have learned that it is called the command line interface and that I generally use it to save my work and control the tree and branches of my projects,
  there are probably several other things that I can do there that I don't know about yet however, that is a fight for another day.

If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
  ...CLI stuff? I'm not 100% on how to answer this question with my severely limited knowledge of CLI's
  
List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code
  sort/map/looping/ect, the list could go on and on but I am very thankful of my predecessors in this field for figuring those things out years ago, I can't 
  imagine what programming would be like without a lot of these things that we take for granted today.
