>Pseudocode is a form of planning that programmers use to layout something that they are going to build, similar to a blueprint for the construction of a building. The programmer can lay their instructions out in plain English and work through the logic of the build without having to deal with limitations or caveats of syntax. It allows a free flow string of thought to be put down and then edited and built out into a full map of how to build and structure your program or feature, it can include variables, functions, loops, and logic flow and can also continually be reworked to fit the program as it grows and changes throughout the development process. Writing your pseudocode well can mean the difference between spending hours trying to work out a functions syntax because you don’t know exactly what you need to accomplish and turning that into a quick series of google searches to find the right tool for the job, and it can mean the difference between a neat and concise program and a program that has things out of order and riddled with scoping issues. Pseudocode is here to make your process easier in the long run, and to help you voice what you need to accomplish to locate gaps in knowledge to fill and potential shortcomings in your process. Write it and write it well, you’ll be happy you did.
