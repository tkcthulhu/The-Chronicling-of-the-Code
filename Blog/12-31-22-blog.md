Well, this has been the year of the journey for me, I left my previous proffession of almost 10 years to pursue something more fufilling. 
I tried a few different avenues and couldn't really seem to find something I liked, I have struggled a lot this year until I finally landed at the bootcamp.
my family has been through a lot over that time, my wife and I have worked day and night to keep our house running and keep the lights on, but it has been worth
it. After taking these last few weeks to have some rest and take a step back from the computer and ground myself, I'm reminded again of my 'why' that I 
wrote on that note card so many weeks ago. I have spent more time with my family in the last 2 weeks than I have all year and I couldn't be more more grateful
for all the wonderful things in my life. The future, while still daunting, is looking brighter and brighter, always forward, never back.
