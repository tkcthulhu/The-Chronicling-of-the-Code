Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
  I definetly thing that you can never underestimate a learning curve, especially in this line of work. That being said, after the initial pain was over with, I really was impressed with what React had to offer. How easily you can put HTML elements up on the page and how dynamic that can end up being with the tools that it offers you.

What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
  I'm not sure what it would be but I'm sure that there are some libraries that will help with setting up mobile development, most of my interests lie in game development and iOS/ Android development, getting into something that will help me be able to actually put my creations on a phone or tablet will be insane!  

Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
  Faker.js will probably be one that I end up using, part of my project will be graphing and analyzing data from users that don't exist so I will need something to generate data that I can work with and test my applications properly.
